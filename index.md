# IPython: the Terminal as a UI

- The terminal is a user interface!
- Challenges:
  - **No narrative**
  - **No memory**
  - **No reproducibility and communication**

# The state of the Classic Notebook

- Very few maintainers, very little time
- But new issues were still coming up on the `jupyter/notebook` repository, but rarely got any replies
- New weekly meeting to triage issues
- \[DISCUSS\] How to improve supportability of the repo? https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/5360

---

# The Reality

- Simplicity is a feature (less is more)
- Still lots of users of the Classic Notebook, especially in education
- Document-centric interface helps remove the noise and focus on the content
- The "tabs-in-tabs" can be confusing (the web browser already has tabs)

---

# Problems

- The Classic Notebook has been unmaintained for years
- It was very difficult to extend and make different extensions co-exist
- Built on "old" web technologies (jQuery)
- And still a lot of people using it!

---

# The initial plan was to **sunset** Notebook üåÖ

---

# The current plan is to **sunrise** Notebook ‚òÄÔ∏è

# Jupyter Enhancement Proposal 79

- "Build Jupyter Notebook v7 off of JupyterLab components"
- Merged on Dec 24, 2021
- https://jupyter.org/enhancement-proposals/79-notebook-v7/notebook-v7.html

---

# RetroLab

- Started end of 2020
- https://github.com/jupyterlab/retrolab
- Built with JupyterLab components and extensions
- But keep the Classic Notebook look and feel
- "RetroLab running on Jupyter Server will be the basis for Notebook v7."

# JupyterLab Extensions

- Most JupyterLab extensions are compatible with Notebook 7
- Popular Classic Notebook extensions have been ported to JupyterLab 4 / Notebook 7
- https://jupyterlab-contrib.github.io/extensions.html
- https://jupyterlab-contrib.github.io/migrate_from_classical.html

---

# Migration

- JupyterLab 4, Notebook 7 and NBClassic 1 can be used together on the same Jupyter Server (**demo**)
- Migration guide available in the documentation:
  - https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrate_to_notebook7.html
  - Describes several scenarios for running both the Classic Notebook and Notebook 7 on the same server

---

# Current State

- Jupyter Notebook `7.0.0b0` is available
- Install it with `pip`: `pip install --pre notebook`
- Install it with `conda`: `conda install -c conda-forge/label/notebook_beta notebook`
- Please test and report issues and feedback!

---

# Where is development happening?

- Notebook 7 is being developed in https://github.com/jupyter/notebook
- The Classic Notebook UI has been moved to https://github.com/jupyter/nbclassic

---

# What's next

- Blog post about Notebook 7 and the Migration Guides
- Notebook 7 Release Candidates
- JupyterLab 4 final release expected for JupyterCon 2023 early May 2023
- Notebook 7 final release expected after JupyterLab 4 (date TBC)

---

# How can I help?

- If you are a user of the Classic Notebook and have concerns, please reach out!
- Please test the JupyterLab 4 and Notebook 7 betas, report issues and give feedback üôè
